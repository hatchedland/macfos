<p>Macfos Laboratory &nbsp;aims at providing the basic concepts &amp; operations of electronic devices and circuits. The
    lab supports the students to build their circuits on breadboard using electronic components, ICs, power supplies,
    micro-controllers and other electronic equipments.<br>The equipments such as meters, power supplies, and signal
    generators are interfaced to the computer to facilitate the operation of experiments. The students can get an
    understanding of the electronic circuits that they are working with and the computer interface aids them in taking
    and analyzing data.<br>This laboratory specializes the projects in the areas of Electronics engineering, control
    engineering and power electronics.</p>
